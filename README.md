# OP-Rick-Bot README

依赖框架：nonebot2 | nonebot2官方地址：https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2 | QQ开放平台：https://q.qq.com  

# 至Hypixel的一封信：
目前我正在运行这个机器人在qq平台，一个中国大陆内人人皆用的社交软件，由于QQ像Discord一样，QQ官方提供了一系列的Bot api帮助开发者开发QQ bot。  
但QQ稍微有些不一样，QQ官方虽然提供bot相关的API来帮助开发者搭建自己的Bot，但由于官方提供的SDK版本过旧，所以大部分人都使用了第三方SDK，比如目前使用的nonebot2就是第三方的SDK。  
当我申请Production API Key的时候被驳回：We cannot grant a production application based on the information provided.  
原因就是上面我说的，由于QQ这款社交软件的特殊性，导致官方虽然提供了bot的api，但由于bot的邀请地址只能在QQ内使用，并且由于申请时无法提供运行截图，导致上一次申请时被拒绝，但实际上我的bot在更新迭代后正在稳定运行，dau超过2500，群聊(就像discord的频道)数量超过3万。此次申请也是因为项目组变更，和之前的不是同一个项目！  
Bot的邀请地址只能在QQ内部使用，但我还是展示出来：https://qun.qq.com/qunpro/robot/qunshare?robot_uin=2854203971

# 下方的截图+视频能证明Rick Bot是可用的，并且正在运行！！！请注意日期，能证明我的Bot现在正在运行！并且视频最后展示了Bot的源代码的仓库(私密)：https://github.com/HOursH/rickbot2
## 项目并不开源，故无法展示源代码，此仓库仅用来证明Bot正在运行，并且还有q.qq.com展示的dau+groups证明！
### 此次申请是由于项目组变更，和之前的Alioth不是同一个项目，所以需要为这个新项目申请专属的production application。

# To a letter from Hypixel:
Currently, I am running this bot on the QQ platform, a widely used social media app in mainland China. Similar to Discord, QQ provides a series of Bot APIs to assist developers in creating QQ bots.  
However, QQ is slightly different. While QQ officially offers bot-related APIs to help developers build their own bots, the official SDK version is outdated, leading most developers to use third-party SDKs. For example, the currently used nonebot2 is a third-party SDK.  
When I applied for a Production API Key, it was rejected: “We cannot grant a production application based on the information provided.”  
The reason is as I mentioned earlier: due to the unique nature of QQ as a social media platform, while the official platform provides bot APIs, the bot's invitation links can only be used within QQ. Additionally, since I couldn't provide screenshots of the bot in operation during the application process, my previous application was rejected. However, my bot is now running stably after updates, with over 2,500 daily active users (DAU) and over 30,000 groups (similar to Discord channels). This application is also due to a change in the project team, and it is not the same project as before!  
The bot's invitation address can only be used within QQ, but I'll show it anyway: https://qun.qq.com/qunpro/robot/qunshare?robot_uin=2854203971  

# The video and screenshots below prove that Rick Bot is available and running! Please note the date, which proves that my bot is currently running! The video also shows the bot's source code repository (private) at the end: https://github.com/HOursH/rickbot2
## The project is not open source, so the source code cannot be displayed. This repository is only used to prove that the Bot is running, and there is also proof of dau+groups displayed on q.qq.com!
### This application is due to changes in the project team. It is not the same project as the previous Alioth, so it is necessary to apply for a dedicated production application for this new project.
