# OP-Rick-Bot

依赖框架：nonebot2
nonebot2官方地址：https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2
QQ开放平台：https://q.qq.com

# 至Hypixel的一封信：
目前我正在运行这个机器人在qq平台，一个中国大陆内人人皆用的社交软件，但是由于QQ像Discord一样，QQ官方提供了一系列的Bot api帮助开发者开发QQ bot。
但QQ则不一样，QQ官方虽然提供bot相关的API来帮助开发者搭建自己的Bot，但由于官方提供的SDK版本过旧，所以大部分人都使用了第三方SDK，比如目前的nonebot2，也就是第三方的bot框架。
当我申请Production API Key的时候被驳回：We cannot grant a production application based on the information provided.
原因就是上面我说的，由于QQ这款社交软件的特殊性，导致官方虽然提供了bot的api，但由于bot的邀请地址只能在QQ内使用，并且由于申请时无法提供运行截图，导致上一次申请时被拒绝，但实际上我的bot在更新迭代后正在稳定运行大约2年，dau超过2500，群聊(就像discord的频道)数量超过3万。此次申请也是因为项目组变更，和之前的不是同一个项目！
# 下方的截图能证明我的bot是可用的，并且正在运行！！！请注意日期，能证明我的bot现在正在运行！
# 项目并不开源，故无法展示源代码，此仓库仅用来证明Bot正在运行，并且还有q.qq.com展示的dau+groups证明！
# Bot的邀请地址只能在QQ内部使用，但我还是展示出来：https://qun.qq.com/qunpro/robot/qunshare?robot_uin=2854203971

# To a letter from Hypixel:
Currently, I am running this bot on the QQ platform, a social media app widely used across mainland China. However, unlike Discord, QQ provides a series of Bot APIs to assist developers in creating QQ bots.  
Nevertheless, QQ differs in that while the official platform offers bot-related APIs to help developers build their own bots, the provided SDK version is outdated. As a result, most developers opt for third-party SDKs, such as the current nonebot2, which is a third-party bot framework.
When I applied for a Production API Key, it was rejected: “We cannot grant a production application based on the information provided.”
The reason is as I mentioned earlier: due to the unique nature of QQ as a social media platform, while the official platform provides bot APIs, the bot's invitation links can only be used within QQ. Additionally, since I couldn't provide screenshots of the bot in operation during the application process, my previous application was rejected. However, in reality, my bot has been running stably for approximately two years after updates and iterations, with a daily active user (DAU) count exceeding 2,500 and over 30,000 groups (similar to Discord channels). This application is also due to a change in the project team, and it is not the same project as before!

# The screenshot below proves that my bot is available and running!!! Please note the date that proves my bot is now running!
# The project is not open source, so the source code cannot be displayed. This repository is only used to prove that the Bot is running, and there is also proof of dau+groups displayed on q.qq.com!
# The bot's invitation address can only be used within QQ, but I'll show it anyway: https://qun.qq.com/qunpro/robot/qunshare?robot_uin=2854203971
